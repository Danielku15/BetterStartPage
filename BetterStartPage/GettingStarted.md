# Basic Usage

**Due to some restrictions within Windows, it's not possible to drag&drop items from 
  a non elevated application (like the normal Windows Explorer) into an elevated one. 
  Please ensure you start Visual Studio with normal user credentials and not using 
  'Run as Administrator', otherwise the dragging projects and solutions into 
  BetterStartPage will not work**
